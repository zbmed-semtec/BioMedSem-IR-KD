lesson:
    "name": 'Semantic Web and Controlled Vocabularies'
    "keywords": 'Controlled vocabulary, Terminology, Ontology'
    "description": 'In this lesson, we will get an overview of Semantic Web followed by an introduction to the spectrum of controlled vocabularies with a focus on those where community agreements play an important role (i.e., terminologies), particularly ontologies and their main elements.'
    "teaches": 
        - '"Understanding what Semantic web is and how it relates to the Web"'
        - '"Explaining the relation between semantics and controlled vocabularies"'
        - '"Distinguishing differences across terminologies in terms of formality and semantics support"' 
        - '"Explaining what an ontology is and describing its main characteristics and elements"'

quizz:
    - "question": 'What are some examples of unstructured data?'
      "answer":   
        - 'Text, images'

    - "question": 'What are some examples of structured data?'
      "answer":   
        - 'Databases following a data schema'

    - "question": 'What is the relation between semantics and Semantic Web'
      "answer":   
        - 'The Semantic Web relies on semantics to: '
        - 'Improve data exchange'
        - 'Make data interpretable by humans and machines'
        - 'Enable data computation based on the meaning of things, e.g., reasoning'

    - "question": 'What are some differences between the Web and the Semantic Web'
      "answer":   
        - 'The Web delivers pages, the Semantic Web delivers data'
        - 'The Web uses IP addresses, the Semantic Web uses identifiers, e.g., URIs'
        - 'The Web pages are not interoperable, the Semantic Web enables data interoperability'

    - "question": 'What are some examples of controlled vocabularies and what characterizes them?' 
      "answer":   
        - 'Lists, a set of controlled elements'
        - 'Taxonomies, with support for hierarchy'
        - 'Thesauri, with support to additional relations such as equivalent to'
        - 'Terminology, a controlled vocabulary agreed by a community'
        - 'Ontology, with reach relations and support for inference'

    - "question": 'What are the main elements in an ontology'
      "answer":   
        - 'Classes: a kind of thing'
        - 'Attributes: characteristics that Individuals and Classes can have'
        - 'Relations: ways for Classes and Individuals to interact/connect with each other'
        - 'Individuals: instances or objects belonging to a Class'
