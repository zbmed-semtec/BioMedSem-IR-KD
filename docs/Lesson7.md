quizz:
    - "question": 'Whay are namespaces useful?'
      "answer":   
        - 'Namespaces provide a context so we can group and distinguish XML elements with the same tag'

      "answer":   
        - 'URI corresponds to Uniform Resource Identifier'

        - 'URIs comprise Uniform Resource Locators (URLs include the access mechanism, e.g., via Internet) and Uniform Resource Names (URNs provide a unique name)'
        - 'URIs provide a unique identity to a resource and can be resolvable to an IP address, e.g., they can be assigned/associated to a URL which can be access directly on the Web'

    - "question": 'What is the basic structure of a URI?'
      "answer":   
        - 'A URI contains the schema (e.g., http), the authority (e.g., wikidata)'

    - "question": 'What is a regular expression?'
      "answer":   
        - 'A description language (or syntax) allowing the specification of language patterns'

        - 'They are useful to, for instance, find patterns along URIs'
