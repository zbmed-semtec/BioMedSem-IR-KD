nav_order: 40

lesson:
    "name": 'Set Theory'
    "keywords": 'Set Theory'
    "description": 'In this lesson we will introduce set theory (how sets are built and how they can be used) and how it connects to graphs. We will then apply this knowledge on sets and graphs to semantic similarity and corresponding measures.'
    "teaches": 
        - '"Understanding what a set is and how they are used in science and other general domains"'
        - '"Explaining how to build a set and how to perform basic operations on it"'
        - '"Explaining how data properties are used to form sets and then do calculations on them (e.g. similarity)"' 
        - '"Explaining what semantic similarity is with examples illustrating its usefulness"'
        - '"Distinguishing, comparing and using different approaches to semantic similarity"'
