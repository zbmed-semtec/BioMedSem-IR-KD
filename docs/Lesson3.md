lesson:
    "name": 'Graphs in computer science and the real world'
    "keywords": 'Graph, Node, Edge'
    "description": 'In this lesson We will learn about graphs, what they are and how they are relevant to knowledge representation. We will also see how they relate to the Semantic Web.'
    "teaches": 
        - '"Describing what a graph is and its main components"'
        - '"Illustrating via examples the use and importance of graphs for knowledge representation"'
        - '"Explaining the relevance of graphs in the semantic web"'

quizz:
    - "question": 'What is a graph?'
      "answer":   
        - 'A graph is a structure consisting of nodes and edges (which connect nodes to each other).'

    - "question": 'What is an acyclic graph?'
      "answer":   
        - 'A graph where there is no path from any node to itself.'
        - 'Example A - B, B - C'

    - "question": 'What is a cyclic graph?'
      "answer":   
        - 'A graph where there is at least one path from one of its nodes to itself.'
        - 'Example A - B, B - C, C - A (cyclic path would be A - B - C - A)'
        
    - "question": 'What are some examples of graphs?'
      "answer":   
        - 'A metro (aka tube or undergraound) network.'
        - 'An organigram.'
        - 'The tree of life.'
