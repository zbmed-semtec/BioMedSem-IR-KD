lesson:
    "name": 'Introduction'
    "keywords": 'Semantic Web, Life Sciences'
    "description": 'In this lesson we will introduce the subject of semantics and show how it plays an important role in life sciences, all illustrated with practical examples.' 
    "teaches": 
        - '"Understanding what semantics is about"'
        - '"Understanding why semantics is needed to use data in the life sciences"'
        - '"Understanding the difference between analyzing data with statistics and using semantics in addition"'
        - '"Listing some examples, where semantics is applied to deal with data in the life science domain, e.g. in medicine"'

quizz:
    - "question": 'Why is semantics important?'
      "answer":   
        - 'Semantics helps give things a label and define them. However, different people can have different understanding on what a thing is about. Semantics help us formally define what a thing is about given a particular context so we all have a common and agreed understanding.'
    
    - "question": 'Which sort of tasks/technologies can be improved with semantics? How does semantics help'
      "answer":   
        - 'Classification, semantic categories enable better search and analysis of data.'
        - 'Semantic search, using concepts rather than free-text keywords makes retrieval more accurate.'
        - 'Data- and text-mining, semantics helps find meaningful associations.'
        - 'Natural language processing NLP, semantics helps transform unstructured text to structured content.'
        - 'Artificial intelligence, semantics enables inference/reasoning so we can find answers to more complex questions.'

    - "question": 'What is Linked Open Data?'
      "answer":   
        - 'Linked Open Data corresponds to structured, i.e., semantic, data interlink with other data.'

    - "question": 'What is a biological process?'
      "answer":   
        - 'Any process specifically pertinent to the functioning of integrated living units:cells, tissues, organs, and organisms.  A process is a collection of molecular events with a defined beginning and end (Gene Ontology).'
        - 'An ordered sequence of biological events.'

    - "question": 'What is a cellular component'
      "answer":   
        - 'The part of a cell or its extracellular environment in which a gene product islocated.  A gene product may be located in one or more parts of a cell and its location may be as specific as a particular macromolecular complex, that is, astable, persistent association of macromolecules that function together (GeneOntology).'
        - 'An observable piece of a cell.'

    - "question": 'What is a molecular function?'
      "answer":   
        - 'Elemental activities, such as catalysis or binding, describing the actions of a geneproduct at the molecular level. A given gene product may exhibit one or moremolecular functions (Gene Ontology).'
        - 'A defined transformation enacted by a molecule.'

    - "question": 'What is a cell?'
      "answer":   
        - 'The basic structural and functional unit of all organisms. Includes the plasmamembrane and any external encapsulating structures such as the cell wall and cell envelope (Gene Ontology).'
        - 'A bodily structure and small functional unit.'

    - "question": 'What is growth from a biomedical perspective?'
      "answer":   
        - 'The increase in size or mass of an entire organism, a part of an organism or acell (Wikipedia).'
        - 'Increased size as the result of a process.'

    - "question": 'What is life from a biomedical perspective?'
      "answer":   
        - 'Organisms are composed of one, or more, cells, undergo metabolism, maintainhomeostasis, can grow, respond to stimuli, reproduce and, through evolution, adapt to their environment in successive generations (by Koshland, Science,2002).'
        - 'Several essential processes contributing to an overall complex process.'
