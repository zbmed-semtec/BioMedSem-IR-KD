Whenever you create or comment on an issue, please be always thoughtful and respectuful toward others. Be open minded and remember that everybody express themselves in different ways, English is not native to everybody so please be forgiveness to some mistakes that might happen.

We cannot promise requests via issues will be fulfilled but we will keep an eye on it.
