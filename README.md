# Lecture on Biomedical semantics, information retrieval and knowledge discovery

This repository aims at hosting updated versions of this lecture.

If any additional subject/improvement is required or a bug should be reported, it is possible to create an issue for it (use the labels ["enhancement"](https://github.com/zbmed-semtec/BioMedSem-IR-KD/labels/enhancement) or ["bug"](https://github.com/zbmed-semtec/BioMedSem-IR-KD/labels/bug) respectively). 

Whenever you create an issue, please be always thoughtful and respectuful toward others. Be open minded and remember that everybody express themselves in different ways, English is not native to everybody so please be forgiveness to some mistakes that might happen. Keep things simple and you probably will be on the right/safe side.

We cannot promise requests via issues will be fulfilled but we will keep an eye on it.

## Motivation
* This lecture on "Biomedical semantics, information retrieval and knowledge discovery" aims at introducing studies with no previous knowledge on the topics to the world of the Semantic Web ad Linked Data with a special focus on Biomedical knowledge and resources.
* You will learn how to use data in a way that it is human and machine readable 
and processable.
* Semantics is used to add labels and meaning to data and to offer opportunities 
to gather and analyse data around labels, meaning and human understandable topics.
* The introduction of semantics requires special formats and standards to make 
the data useful for the general public to provide interoperability.

## Who can use this material?
